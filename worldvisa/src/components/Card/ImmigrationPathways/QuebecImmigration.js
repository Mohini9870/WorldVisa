          The province of Quebec has its own immigration system with its own
          selection criteria that is separate from Immigration, Refugees and
          Citizenship Canada (IRCC) programs and also separate from the PNP.
          Applicants who are selected to immigrate to Quebec are given a Quebec
          Selection Certificate, or Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ).
          This is a document that is issued by Quebec’s Immigration Ministry.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
          You are able to apply for a CSQ through one of Quebec’s immigration
          programs

        <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
          You do not need to have an Express Entry profile to apply. You can
          apply directly to a PNP stream. These are called ‘base’ streams.
